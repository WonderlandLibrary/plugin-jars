Installation

Client side
To install the anticheat on the client just place the CavaAntiCheatClient.jar in the mods folder. Once the anticheat is installed on the server only the players with the anticheat installed on the client will be able to join the server; in other words the client side installation is not optional.

Server side
Place the CavaAntiCheatServer.jar in the plugins folder, then after the first startup you have to configure the whitelist.
You have to calculate the SHA-256 hashes for your Minecraft version jar, your forge version jar and for CavaAntiCheatClient jar (you can find the first two jars in %appdata%/.minecraft/versions).
